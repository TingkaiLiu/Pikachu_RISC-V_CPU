    Think carefully about IF
        only load pc when pipeline moves
        need to know whether br_en is useful (whether it is a BR inst)
            handle in control instead, since JAL and JALR won't have that 
    Clock gating is feasible when stage is not needed 
    Pass control signals from control or buffer?
        Let use control to pass, although there is a copy in buffer
        in this way the skipping would be easier
    Problem: The ID also need two cycles
        although it will be covered by IF and MEM
        but it don't have a way to indicate it is done
